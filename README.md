Quickly enable or disable debug mode!

Allows you to toggle the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) without disconnecting from USB or heading into the developer menu. Perhaps your device's debugger occasionally stops responding? No worries, restarting it is done in a jiffy!

This app often resolves launch errors such as:
* com.android.ddmlib.SyncException: Too many open files
* java.io.IOException: Unable to open sync connection!

Includes a simple interface and two widgets. Requires root permissions.
